Share your daily/family photos on your blog sidebar easily. 

== Description ==

There are several photoblog plugins for WordPress around the Internet. Most of them, suppose that you are a professional photographer who make lots of money via his/her camera but I don't think so!

Sidebar Photoblog doesn't use lots of server resources and hasn't many confusing options. It uses WordPress functions to get maximum  compatibility and flexibility.

Sidebar Photoblog is simple, light and easy to use. It also has some nice effects and an archive page for your photos.

It's first release so let me know if you found a bug or have any comment. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use it? =

After installation the plugin automatically creates a category called 'Sidebar Photoblog' and a page as photo archive:'Browse Photos'. You can edit that category and page via WordPress but "[sphoto_archive]" should remain in the page content.

To insert your photos:

1) Click for new post and choose photoblog category (usally 'Sidebar Photoblog').
2) Upload your photo via WordPress Editor (don't use 'From URL' tab).
3) Insert full size image into post and publish it.

That's all! 

It's completely flexible you can upload several photos or add your own content.

= Any other thing? =

-You can customize padding, borders,etc using CSS (Don't forget to disable style related options in widget settings first).
-If your theme can't show large photos properly change 'Max Width' in Settings->Media. You can also change thumbnail size and size of preview pop-up image('Medium size') over there.
  

== Installation ==

While doing the installation procedure, it is recommended to go through all the steps first before viewing the output. If you don't, you'll get nasty error messages.
