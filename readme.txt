= How can I use it? =

After installation, the plug-in automatically creates a category called ‘Sidebar Photo blog’ and a page for a photo archive called `Photos’. You can edit those categories and pages via WordPress but “[sphoto_archive]” should remain in the page content.
To Insert Your Photos
	1.Click for new posts and choose the photo blog category (usually ‘Sidebar Photo blog’).
	2.Upload your photo via the WordPress Editor (don’t use ‘From URL’ tab).
	3.Insert the full size image into post and publish it.
It’s that easy!

It is very flexible.  You can upload several photos and add your own content.


= My photos show in main column of the blog? =

Please remove Recent Posts Widget from your sidebar. This problem will be solved in next version.

= Any other thing? =

-You can customize padding, borders,etc using CSS (Don't forget to disable style related options in widget settings first).
-If your theme can't show large photos properly change 'Max Width' in Settings->Media. You can also change thumbnail size and size of preview pop-up image('Medium size') over there.
  
=Would you like to show your photos in main page?=
Open sidebar-photoblog.php with a text-editor(like notepad) search for "exclude_from_home" and change it to false.
